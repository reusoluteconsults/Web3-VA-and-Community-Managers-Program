Welcome, Orientation & Expectations

Welcome to the Program!

Welcome to the Web3 Virtual Assistant & Community Operations Program.

This program is designed to help you build real, usable skills that prepare you for remote work—specifically within Web3 teams and online communities.

This is not casual learning.
This is professional skill training.


How This Program Is Structured

Duration: 12 weeks

Format: Self-paced + occasional Instructor-led Videos

Learning environment: GitHub & Discord

Focus: Execution, not theory

Each week builds on the previous one. Skipping lessons or rushing ahead will weaken your foundation.

What “Self-Paced” Really Means

Self-paced does not mean:

- Learn when you feel like it

- Skip practical work

- Watch/Read content without applying it

Self-paced actually means:

- You control when you study

- Standards remain the same for everyone

- Progress depends on your discipline

Remote work rewards discipline more than intelligence.


Time Commitment Expectations

You are expected to commit:

i. 1.5 – 2.5 hours daily

ii. At least 5 days per week

Consistency matters more than intensity.


Scholarship & Performance Expectations

During your first 2 weeks:

- Everyone starts with full access

- Performance is evaluated continuously

- Exceptional students earn scholarships

Scholarships are earned through effort and quality, not enthusiasm.

How Platforms Will Be Used

- Discord: Learning, submissions, discussions, Annoucements

- WhatsApp: Backup platform

Always read instructions carefully before posting.


Your Responsibility as a Student

i. Show up consistently
