Communication Skills for Remote Teams
Why Communication Is a Core VA Skill


Most problems in remote teams are communication problems, not technical ones.

Good communication:

- Reduce mistakes

Bad questions:

- Are vague

- Show no effort

- Wastes time


Giving Updates & Reports

i. What was done

ii. What is pending

iii. Any blockers

Avoid excuses. Provide clarity.


Assignment

Respond to 3 simulated scenarios: assume the role of a Web3 Virtual Assistant and respond to your Boss in the following events;

1. Asking for task clarification
Scenario 1: NFT Community Moderation

Context:
A project lead (your Boss) says:

“Monitor the Discord and keep the community engaged today.”

Ask clarifying questions about:

i. Engagement metrics (replies, events, announcements)

ii. Time window

iii. Escalation rules


2. Reporting task completion
