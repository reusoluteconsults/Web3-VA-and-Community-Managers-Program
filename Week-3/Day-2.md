Core Web3 Concepts (Simplified)
You Do NOT Need Technical Depth

As a Web3 VA, you are not expected to code.
You are expected to understand context.

Key Concepts You Should Understand

i. Blockchain: A shared, transparent record system

ii. Cryptocurrency: Digital assets used within ecosystems

iii. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens): Unique digital items (art, access, identity)

iv. DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): Community-governed organizations

You don’t need to explain how they are built - only what they represent.


Why These Concepts Matter to VAs

They influence:

i. Community behavior

ii. Communication tone

iii. Project values

iv. User expectations

Understanding them prevents embarrassing mistakes.
