What Web3 Really Is (And What It Is Not)
Why This Matters

Many people hear “Web3” and think:

- Trading

- Coding

- Scam projects

- Get-rich-quick schemes

That confusion prevents capable people from entering the space.

This course is about working in Web3, not speculating in it.


What Web3 Is (Simple Explanation)

Web3 refers to a new way of building and running digital products where:

i. Ownership is more distributed - not owned by one person

ii. Communities matter deeply (that is why you are learning to become a community manager)

iii. Users often participate in governance

iv. Transparency is higher than traditional companies

Web3 is not magic.
It is an organizational and technological shift.


What Web3 Is NOT

Web3 is not:

- A guarantee of wealth

- Only about trading crypto

- Only for developers

- A shortcut to success

Web3 still requires:

i. Work

ii. Discipline

iii. Communication

iv. Trust


Why Web3 Needs Virtual Assistants

Web3 teams are:

- Global

- Remote (people working from home instead of an office building)

- Community-driven

- Always online

This creates more need, not less, for organized support roles.
